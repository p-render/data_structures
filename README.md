Some Data Structures in Python
===============

Examples of common data structures implemented in Python.  Each will include two
files, one with the implementation and a second test file to be run with Py Test.

Currently includes:

###linked.py(test_linked.py)
implements a linked list without using the Python list type.

###stack.py (test_stack.py)
implements a first in, first out stack based on the linked list module.  

Both of the previous owe some aknowledgement to Chapters 18 & 19 of 
[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/ch18.html), by Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey, 
and Chris Meyers
*(http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/ch18.html)*

###parens.py (test_parens.py) 
takes some text and returns 1, 0, -1 depending on 
if the parentheses in the text are closed correctly or not.
